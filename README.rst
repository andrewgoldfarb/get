get
=====================

This directory is used to simplify the instalation process of cloudmesh for users of 

* ubuntu
* futuregrid (using ubuntu)


If you have an install for other OS please let us know and we can upload it here.

However the instalation of cloudmesh is actually very simple via the scripts we provide 
as part of the cloudmesh code. Thus inm principal, you do not need this.
